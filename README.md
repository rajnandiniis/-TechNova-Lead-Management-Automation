# TechNova Solutions: Lead Management Workflow

This repository contains a solution for automating the lead management process for **TechNova Solutions**. The goal is to streamline the process of capturing leads, scoring them, handling edge cases, and scaling the workflow as the company grows. The solution leverages **Zapier**, **Google Forms**, **Google Sheets**, **Gmail**, and **Google Calendar** to automate various tasks.

---

## Overview

The workflow includes three main tasks:
1. **Basic Lead Capture and Scoring**: Automates the process of capturing leads and assigning scores based on criteria such as company size, annual budget, industry, and urgency.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: Addresses issues like incomplete data, high-value leads slipping through the cracks, and leads from different time zones.
3. **Scaling and Advanced Implementation**: Implements lead distribution to sales reps, uses keyword extraction for lead categorization, and sets up follow-up reminders using Google Calendar.

## Task 1: Basic Lead Capture and Scoring

### Description:
The goal of this task is to automate the lead capture process and implement a lead scoring system. The form contains fields like **Company Size**, **Annual Budget**, **Industry**, and **Urgency of Need**. Based on the values submitted, a score is calculated for each lead, and actions are taken depending on their score.

### Lead Scoring System:
- **Company Size**:
  - 1-50 employees = 10 points
  - 51-200 employees = 20 points
  - 201-1000 employees = 30 points
  - 1000+ employees = 40 points
- **Annual Budget**:
  - Less than $10,000 = 10 points
  - $10,000 - $50,000 = 20 points
  - $50,001 - $100,000 = 30 points
  - More than $100,000 = 40 points
- **Industry**:
  - Technology = 10 points
  - Finance = 20 points
  - Healthcare = 30 points
  - Retail = 20 points
  - Other = 10 points
- **Urgency of Need**:
  - Immediate (within 1 month) = 40 points
  - Short-term (1-3 months) = 30 points
  - Medium-term (3-6 months) = 20 points
  - Long-term (6+ months) = 10 points

Total score is the sum of the points for each criterion.

### Workflow:
1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts when a new form submission is received via **Google Forms**.
2. **Calculate Lead Score**: The **Zapier Formatter** is used to calculate the lead score based on the submitted form data.
3. **Add to Google Sheets**: The lead’s data along with their score is added to a Google Sheets document.
4. **Action**: 
   - **Score > 70**: Sends a personalized welcome email via **Gmail**.
   - **Score < 70**: Adds the lead to a separate Google Sheets document for nurturing.

### Deliverable:
- **Screenshot of the Zap**: The Zapier workflow, including the trigger and actions.
- **Explanation**: Detailed description of the lead scoring system and its functionality.

## Task 2: Handling Edge Cases

### Edge Case Solutions:

1. **Handling Incomplete Data**:
   - **Solution**: Implement a Zapier filter to check for missing fields (e.g., company size, budget). If a lead has incomplete data, it is added to a "Follow-up Needed" Google Sheet for further action.
   
2. **High-Value Leads**:
   - **Solution**: Modify the scoring system to ensure high-value leads (e.g., leads with a budget greater than $100,000 or a company size over 1000 employees) are prioritized. These leads are flagged for immediate follow-up.
   
3. **Handling Different Time Zones**:
   - **Solution**: Use Zapier's date/time tools to automatically adjust follow-up tasks according to the lead's time zone. The workflow will store the lead’s time zone in Google Sheets and schedule follow-up emails at appropriate times using **Google Calendar**.

### Deliverable:
- **Screenshot of the Updated Zap**: Showing how edge cases are handled.
- **Explanation**: Explanation of how each edge case is addressed in the workflow.

## Task 3: Scaling and Advanced Implementation

### Enhancements:

1. ## Lead Distribution to Sales Reps (Round-Robin System)

### Solution Overview:
The goal of the **Lead Distribution** system is to assign incoming leads to sales reps evenly using a **round-robin** approach. The round-robin logic ensures that each sales rep receives an equal number of leads, optimizing workload distribution.

### Logic:
The **round-robin** system can be implemented using Google Sheets functions like **COUNT** and **MOD**. Here’s how it works:

1. **COUNT Function**: Used to count the number of leads already assigned to each sales rep.
2. **MOD Function**: The **MOD** function can be used to determine which sales rep should be assigned the next lead. The function will return the remainder when the lead count is divided by the total number of sales reps, ensuring the leads are distributed in a cyclical manner.

### Implementation Details:
1. Create a column in Google Sheets called “Assigned Sales Rep.”
2. Set up a **round-robin** formula using **COUNT** and **MOD** to determine which sales rep gets the next lead.
   - Example formula: `=MOD(COUNT(A$2:A2), number_of_sales_reps) + 1`
   - This formula counts the number of leads already assigned and assigns the next one based on the remainder, ensuring a round-robin distribution.

### Challenges and Limitations:
While the round-robin lead distribution system is feasible and efficient for even lead distribution, **due to time/resource constraints**, I could not implement this feature in the current setup. However, I have provided the logic and approach, and it can be implemented in the future for improved lead distribution.

### Conclusion:
The round-robin system can be seamlessly integrated into the current lead management workflow, and the logic for its implementation has been outlined above. It is a valuable addition for ensuring that sales reps are equally assigned leads, improving efficiency.

2. **Keyword Extraction for Lead Categorization**:
   - **Solution**: Use **Zapier Formatter** to extract keywords from the "Comments" field in the lead submission form. These keywords help categorize the lead into specific segments like "Enterprise", "SMB", or "Startup".

3. **Lead Follow-up System**:
   - **Solution**: Integrate **Google Calendar** to create follow-up reminders for sales reps. The follow-up date is dynamically set based on the urgency of the lead's need, ensuring timely outreach.

### Deliverable:
- **Screenshot of the Final Zap**: The enhanced workflow showing the new features.
- **Explanation**: Detailed explanation of how each new feature works, along with any limitations you foresee.

     1. Capture form submissions.
     2. Calculate the lead score.
     3. Add data to Google Sheets.
     4. Send emails or schedule follow-ups via Gmail and Google Calendar.

4. **Test the System**:
   - Submit test leads via the Google Form and verify if the leads are properly scored, categorized, and followed up with.
